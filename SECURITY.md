## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can contact me directly via  my email @ patrick at devsec .ie 
(of course just combine the email address and insert the @ symbol) 

I update any vulnerabilities as soon as it's accepted as quick as possible.

Remember, this is in Alpha stage at the moment and is opensource under the MIT all in my own time outside my normal work hours.
